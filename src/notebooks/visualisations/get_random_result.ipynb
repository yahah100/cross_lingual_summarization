The German Bundestag held its first constituent session on 7 September 1949 in the Federal Parliament building in Bonn. The ultimate goal of post-war politicians was to establish a stable democracy. Over the next four years, MPs met in 282 plenary sessions - many of which never happened again - and passed 545 laws. Today, Germans live in a prosperous and economically successful country. Nevertheless, many citizens are dissatisfied with the work of their Parliament, as a recent study by the European Commission shows. Heinrich Oberreuter, political scientist from Passau and deputy chairman of the German Association for Parliamentary Questions, has been researching German parliamentarism for decades. SZ: Mr. Oberreuter, retired president Paul Löbe opened the first session of the new Bundestag with the words: \"What does the German people hope for from the work of the Bundestag? That we build a stable government, a healthy economy, a new social order in a secure private life, that we lead our fatherland towards a new prosperity and prosperity. \" Are we allowed to say, 70 years later, \"Mission accomplished?\" Heinrich Oberreuter: That can be said without reservation from todays point of view. At that time it was a question of building a republic and economic and social order. This was a success story that could neither be expected nor hoped for during the founding period of the Federal Republic of Germany. One consequence of this construction success, however, was the pluralization of interests in society. Eventually, not all the interests of the welfare state could be perfectly satisfied. The country was no longer in need and the needs of the people differed. And so the Bundestag also faces new challenges. What challenges do you think? The first is to regain confidence. Seventy years ago, we were in a very bad situation when it came to public assessments of Members abilities. This has developed later demoscopically pleasing upwards. Today, it is back to the low levels of the 1950s. Trust is needed. Parliament must show that it can satisfy social and economic interests. The second challenge is to provide answers to complex international developments. Some developments even exceed the competence of experts. In addition to the everyday',\n",

Polish Foreign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna said he expected him to say sorry so the matter can be settled. Comey said last week, 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do. That's what people do. And that should truly frighten us.' FBI director James Comey, pictured at a news conference last month, has caused huge offense to a U.S. ally by using language to suggest that Poles were accomplices in the Holocaust . Comey's comments are particularly offensive to Poles not only because they had no role in running Auschwitz and other death camps where Jews were murdered during World War II, but because they were themselves victims of the Third Reich. In all, 6 million Polish citizens were killed during the war, about half of them Jewish and the other half Christians, with many Polish priests, members of the intelligentsia and political resistance killed in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Poland also had a committed anti-Nazi resistance movement and Polish fighters fought alongside the Allies throughout the war.

This seems to have become too much for some in the authority. When the Federal Employment Agency (BA) introduced its new board member Valerie Holsboer in a press release on 31 March 2017, the former boss of an employers \"association was described as\" an experienced negotiator. \" At the time, this referred to difficult collective bargaining. But now, just over two years after becoming the first woman to serve on BAs board, the 42-year-old has to prove her negotiating skills on her own. Because her chair on BAs three-man board is shaking violently. Bild am Sonntag reported at the weekend that the lawyer was to be removed at the next meeting of BA's board of directors on July 12. The Board of Directors is the powerful supervisory body of the Nuremberg authority it proposes the Executive Board to the Federal Government. The Board of Directors consists of one-third employer and employee representatives and delegates from federal and state ministries as well as municipalities. The three board members of the Federal Agency can also be roughly assigned to one \"bank\": employer, employee plus one member from the Federal Employment Agency itself. Headwinds from Holsboer's own camp, which is responsible for human resources and finance on the Executive Board, are on the employers \"side in this reading prior to her move to Nuremberg, she was chief executive of the Federal Association of Catering Systems. Which makes it all the more surprising that the headwind seems to come from Holsboer's own camp. BA's chief executive, Peter Clever, is said to have told her that she would be voted out of office the employee side no longer supports her either. Clever, a member of the executive board of the employers \"association BDA, was not available for comment, nor was Annelie Buntenbach, a board member of the German Trade Union Confederation and BA vice-chairman. The 61-year-old Christiane Schönefeld, head of the North Rhine-Westphalia regional directorate, is seen as a possible successor. Board members said Holsboer's approach to the central question of how the BA should be set up in times of low but entrenched unemployment was not strategic and \\\\\n",

      "\t\t\\textbf{Article English:} summarize English to English: Münster in Westphalia is full of ancient sights: the cathedral from the 13th century, the castle from the 18th century and the football stadium of 1926. It was here that Prussia played Münster when the club finished second in the German championship in 1951 and when it competed in the founding season of the Bundesliga in 1963 / 64. Prussia Münster still plays in this stadium today. In the near future, the half-dilapidated Prussian stadium is to be rebuilt on the spot and made fit for the future, so that another legacy can be ticked off: the now 28-year-old dream of returning to the second division. Already this summer, SC Prussias football team, which is not worth seeing, was retreaded in this remarkable city with a new coach, twelve new players and new promotion hopes for the ninth consecutive season in the third division. It opens on Friday as a guest of TSV 1860 Munich. Founding member of the Bundesliga, this sounds more like impoverished nobility in Münsters case, because they have never played in the Bundesliga since immediate relegation in 1964. The second league was also a long time ago: 1991. The Münsterans have been playing in the single-track third league since 2011. When depressed representatives of insolvent traditional clubs complain again and again that the third league is a kind of pathway to the dead because of insufficient TV income, the Münsterans must be commended for having arranged themselves reasonably comfortably. In eight seasons they have never been worse than 12th - but never better than fourth. Of course, the Westphalians would have liked to have escaped to the second division, but every new attempt went wrong. Indeed, Munster are the last remaining team to play consistently in the third division since 2011. SV Wehen Wiesbaden had faithfully accompanied the Prussians in these eight years, but has just made the leap to the second division. Now Münster is the last constant in a league in which through traffic is reminiscent of a busy central station. So now the ninth attempt. To this end, the Münster-based club are banking on coach Sven Hübscher, 40, who last coached Werder Bremen's second team for almost one and a half years. He took up his job in Bremen shortly before the inevitable relegation from the third division \\\\\n",

Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim, Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as \\\\\n",

    "input_text_de = \" Für 29,99 Euro nach Antalya, für 39,99 Euro nach Djerba oder Jerez de la Frontera - wer Condor fliegt, fliegt mit ein bisschen Glück gerade sehr günstig. Auf der Website bewirbt die Ferienfluggesellschaft die Niedrigtarife unter dem Label \\\"Kurzfliegen\\\" - also nicht so weit weg und mal kurz für ein paar Tage in die Sonne, es ist ja günstig. Neu ist das Konzept nicht, aber nun entfaltet sich eine politische Diskussion um die Preise, die für das Unternehmen gefährlich werden könnte. Bietet Condor, gerade mit einem Staatskredit von 380 Millionen Euro über Wasser gehalten, Flüge zum Dumpingtarif an? Und wie verträgt sich das mit dem Klimapakt? \\\"Kampfpreise und Marktgewinnungsstrategien mit Steuergeld zu machen, ist ein Unding\\\", sagt der stellvertretende Vorsitzende der FDP-Bundestagsfraktion Michael Theurer. \\\"Der Bundestag muss Zugang zu sämtlichen Unterlagen bekommen, damit sich die Abgeordneten ein Bild davon machen können, ob eine Zweckentfremdung des Kredits vorliegt\\\", so der Politiker. \\\"Eine Wettbewerbsverzerrung mit Staatsknete und eine Quersubventionierung von Billigtickets sind inakzeptabel.\\\" Die Bundesregierung und das Land Hessen hatten nach der Pleite des Reiseveranstalters Thomas Cook, zu dem Condor gehört, zugesagt, für einen KfW-Kredit zu bürgen. Das Geld braucht Condor für den kommenden Winter, in dem Ferien-Airlines traditionell Verluste machen, die sie, wenn es gut läuft, im Sommer überkompensieren. Durch die Pleite der Muttergesellschaft war das Cash-Polster für die aufkommensschwache Zeit weg. Condor bekam den Kredit und befindet sich in einem Schutzschirmverfahren, einer Variante der Insolvenz, bei der das Unternehmen nach drei Monaten ein Insolvenzverfahren in Eigenverwaltung durchlaufen kann. Auch die Condor-Konkurrenz murrt schon vernehmlich, dass sie es nun mit einer staatlich unterstützten Fluggesellschaft aufnehmen muss, die über Billigpreise Marktanteile gewinnen wolle. Bei Tuifly kostet der Flug nach Heraklion mindestens 93,74 Euro, bei Condor dagegen nur 39,99 Euro. Lufthansa-Ableger Eurowings bietet viele europäische Ziele für Preise ab 29,99 Euro an, Heraklion gibt es ab 49,99 Euro. Allerdings erhält Eurowings keine Staatshilfen, und normalerweise wird nur ein kleiner Teil der Kapazität im Einzelplatzverkauf zu diesen Einstiegspreisen angeboten. Bei Condor aber geht es auch um die Kontingente, die die Airline an Reiseveranstalter verkaufen will, nachdem ihr durch die Thomas-Cook-Pleite 20 Prozent der Kunden verloren gegangen sind. Die Veranstalter greifen derzeit gerne die Billigkontingente ab, so ein Insider, und decken sich damit für den Winter ein. \\\"Das ist nicht vergleichbar mit den Vorjahren\\\", sagt er. Condor-Vertriebschef Paul Schwaiger hofft, die hohe Nachfrage der anderen Veranstalter werde die Lücke schließen. Zu spüren bekommen dies nun Konkurrenten wie Eurowings, Tuifly oder Sun Express. Heikle Situation für die Bundesregierung \\\"Alle Airlines bieten derzeit attraktive Angebote für Flüge in der Nebensaison, um diese auszulasten, so auch Condor\\\", teilte Condor mit. Bei den Günstigtarifen handele es sich um eine lang geplante Preisaktion, die sich mit der Insolvenz der Thomas Cook überschnitten habe und nicht mehr gestoppt werden konnte. Sie sei am 3. Oktober ausgelaufen. Die günstigen Angebote für Einzelplätze waren aber auch danach noch verfügbar. Den Reiseveranstaltern werden dem Vernehmen nach ebenfalls weiterhin günstige Angebote unterbreitet. Ein Beobachter weist darauf hin, dass auch Air Berlin nach dem Insolvenzantrag im August 2017 versucht habe, der Konkurrenz Marktanteile abzunehmen. Für die Bundesregierung ist die Situation politisch heikel. Gerade erst hat sie im Klimapakt beschlossen, die Luftverkehrsabgabe zu erhöhen, um das Fliegen zu verteuern und zu verhindern, dass die Fluggesellschaften zu billige Tickets verkaufen, die die wahren (Umwelt-)Kosten der Reisen nicht widerspiegeln. Die Union hatte darüber hinaus ernsthaft erwogen, den Airlines Mindestpreise von rund 50 Euro vorzuschreiben. Ins Klimapaket der Bundesregierung wurde diese Forderung letztlich aber nicht übernommen. Hingegen soll die Steuer nach einem Referentenentwurf des Bundesfinanzministeriums erhöht werden - um 2,93 Euro für Strecken innerhalb Deutschlands und Europas (Distanzklasse 1) und um 16,45 Euro für Langstrecken (Distanzklasse 3). Bei einem Langstreckenflug sind damit künftig 58,63 Euro fällig, bei Kurzstrecken 10,43 Euro. Insgesamt soll die Steuer die Branche mit rund 500 Millionen Euro belasten.\"\n",
